LIST COMPREHENSION

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "kiwi", "mango"]
newlist = [1:2]

for x in fruits:
  if "a" in x:
    newlist.append(x)

print(newlist) --- app, ban, mang


# Same as above
newlist = [x for x in fruits if "a" in x]



newlist = [expression for item in iterable if condition == True]

ie.
newlist = [x for x in fruits if x != "apple"] --- wont put apple in new list

UPPERCASE
newlist = [x.upper() for x in fruits]

can set the output x
newlist = ['hello' for x in fruits] --- 'hello''hello''hello''hello''hello'

can add conditions to output x
newlist = [x if x != "banana" else "orange" for x in fruits] --- "apple", "orange", "cherry", "kiwi", "mango"
